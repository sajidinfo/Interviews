### **1. Agile Methodology**  
#### **Q1: What is Agile, and what are its core principles?**  
**A:** Agile is an iterative approach to software development that focuses on delivering value incrementally. Its core principles include:  
- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.  
- Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development.  
- Delivering working software frequently (weeks rather than months).  
- Collaboration between business stakeholders and developers.  
- Motivated individuals with trust and support.  
- Face-to-face communication (preferred).  
- Working software as the primary measure of progress.  
- Sustainable development pace.  
- Continuous attention to technical excellence.  
- Simplicity.  
- Self-organizing teams.  
- Regular reflection and adaptation.  

#### **Q2: What are the key differences between Agile and Waterfall?**  
**A:**  
| **Agile** | **Waterfall** |  
|-----------|--------------|  
| Iterative & Incremental | Linear & Sequential |  
| Flexible to changes | Rigid (changes are costly) |  
| Continuous customer feedback | Feedback at the end |  
| Short sprints (2-4 weeks) | Long phases (months) |  
| Cross-functional teams | Siloed teams (Dev, QA, etc.) |  

#### **Q3: How do you handle changing requirements in Agile?**  
**A:** Agile embraces change. We:  
- Prioritize new requirements in the backlog.  
- Discuss impact in sprint planning/refinement.  
- Adjust upcoming work while maintaining sprint goals.  
- Ensure stakeholders understand trade-offs (time/cost).
